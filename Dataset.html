	<h1> What is the dataset? </h1><br>
		<p> The data set shows 'Place of Usual Residence on Census Night by Age'. The age groups are segmented into 10 year baskets from the age of 0 to 85 and over. The models will focus on age groups 0-14 year olds, 15-24 yo, 25-34yo etc. <br>
		Based on the assumption of data collected on this '1 night' timeframe, I have modelled the dataset to visualise where certain age groups tend to be during the night. There is also data to visualize where these certain age groups are usually living throughout Sydney. </p>

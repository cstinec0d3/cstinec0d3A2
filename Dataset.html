				<h2 class="dataset-heading">DATASET</h2>
				<p class="dataset-text"> The data is collected as a study of the population trends in Australia. It is collected every 5 years so that there is benchmark data for future studies. This information may be useful to lawmakers, marketing companies, political groups or for the curiosity of the general public.
					This data could for example provide broader information on where families reside in NSW and indicate a story on Sydney's housing crisis. By collating the data, the government is provided a visual guide to plan and provide for Sydney's logistical needs. </p>

				<h2> Government Data Usage</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Department of Education &amp Training > NSW Department of Education</li>
					<ul style="list-style-type:none"><li>The data would be useful to study where young families and children are living to ensure that there is sufficient access to early age education, right through to primary and secondary education.</li></ul>
					<li> Department of Infrastructure &amp Regional Development > NSW Department of Transport </li>
					<ul style="list-style-type:none"><li>To determine where more road networks and public transport is required to ease out congestion of the population coming into the Sydney CBD.</li></ul>

				</ul>

				<h2> Private Sector Data Usage </h2>

				<ul>
				<li>Consumer Discretionary > Clubs, Dining, Shopping Centres, Gyms </li>
					<ul style="list-style-type:none"><li>These private sectors involving consumer disrectionary would find that by having this data on hand, they are able to plan development in areas where certain age groups are populated during the night. By locating themselves near population dense areas, they are able to gain the best exposure for trade.</li></ul>

					<li> Consumer Staples > Supermarket stores </li>
					<ul style="list-style-type:none"><li>Supermarket stores i.e. Woolworths, Coles and petrol stations able to develop in areas where there is major housing development that are further away from already existing supermarkets. By have this data, they are able to strategize best areas for development.
</li></ul>
					<li> Property Developers </li>
					<ul style="list-style-type:none"><li>
					This private sector is able to distinguish hotspots for housing development within the suburbs or develop high rise buildings closer to public transport for young adults who need to travel to the CBD for their jobs. 
					</li></ul>

				</ul>


				<h2> Thinking about Space </h2>
				<p>Living location in Sydney depends on many factors. It will depend on age, income, relationship status and family. It will also depend on where jobs are located in comparison to where usual residence is. The study in the data set has found particularly interesting patterns for where age groups are living. <br>
				In this particular study, initially the assumption can be made that age group 0-14 live with a typical Sydney family. Another assumption made was that, age group 25-34 are adults with full time jobs that require public transport to get to. </p>
